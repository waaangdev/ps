### 문제 설명

<p>Once upon a time in a strange situation, people called a number <em>ugly</em> if it was divisible by any of the one-digit primes (2, 3, 5 or 7). Thus, 14 is ugly, but 13 is fine. 39 is ugly, but 121 is not. Note that 0 is ugly. Also note that negative numbers can also be ugly; -14 and -39 are examples of such numbers.</p>

<p>One day on your free time, you are gazing at a string of digits, something like:</p>

<pre>123456
</pre>

<p>You are amused by how many possibilities there are if you are allowed to insert <em>plus</em> or <em>minus</em> signs between the digits. For example you can make</p>

<pre>1 + 234 - 5 + 6 = 236
</pre>

<p>which is ugly. Or</p>

<pre>123 + 4 - 56 = 71
</pre>

<p>which is not ugly.</p>

<p>It is easy to count the number of different ways you can play with the digits: Between each two adjacent digits you may choose put a plus sign, a minus sign, or nothing. Therefore, if you start with D digits there are 3<sup>D-1</sup> expressions you can make.</p>

<p>Note that it is fine to have leading zeros for a number. If the string is "01023", then "01023", "0+1-02+3" and "01-023" are legal expressions.</p>

<p>Your task is simple: Among the 3<sup>D-1</sup> expressions, count how many of them evaluate to an ugly number.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input file contains the number of cases, <strong>N</strong>. Each test case will be a single line containing a non-empty string of decimal digits.</p>

<p>Limits</p>

<ul>
	<li>0 <= <strong>N</strong> <= 100.</li>
	<li>The string in each test case will be non-empty and will contain only characters '0' through '9'.</li>
	<li>Each string is no more than 13 characters long.</li>
</ul>

### 출력 

 <p>For each test case, you should output a line </p>

<pre>Case #<strong>X</strong>: <strong>Y</strong></pre>

<p>where <strong>X</strong> is the case number, starting from 1, and <strong>Y</strong> is the number of expressions that evaluate to an ugly number.</p>
