### 문제 설명

<p>At the entrance to the university, there is a huge rectangular billboard of size h×w (h is its height and w is its width). The board is the place where all possible announcements are posted: nearest programming competitions, changes in the dining room menu, and other important information.</p>

<p>On September 1, the billboard was empty. One by one, the announcements started being put on the billboard.</p>

<p>Each announcement is a stripe of paper of unit height. More specifically, the i-th announcement is a rectangle of size 1 × wi. When someone puts a new announcement on the billboard, she would always choose the topmost possible position for the announcement. Among all possible topmost positions she would always choose the leftmost one.</p>

<p>If there is no valid location for a new announcement, it is not put on the billboard (that’s why some programming contests have no participants from this university).</p>

<p>Given the sizes of the billboard and the announcements, your task is to find the numbers of rows in which the announcements are placed.</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of the input file contains three integer numbers, h, w, and n (1 ≤ h,w ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>; 1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the dimensions of the billboard and the number of announcements.</p>

<p>Each of the next n lines contains an integer number w<sub>i</sub> (1 ≤ w<sub>i</sub> ≤ 10<sup>9</sup>) — the width of i-th announcement.</p>

### 출력 

 <p>For each announcement (in the order they are given in the input file) output one number — the number of the row in which this announcement is placed. Rows are numbered from 1 to h, starting with the top row. If an announcement can’t be put on the billboard, output “-1” for this announcement.</p>
